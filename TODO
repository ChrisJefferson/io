Before submitting still to do:

read manual once completely

future:

add some checks to GAP's autoconf configure script to test for more
headers, for example:
  netinet/in.h
  netinet/ip.h
  netinet/tcp.h
possibly some Linux-specific things:
  linux/in.h ???
More tests?

(far) future:

support routines for http requests? (query strings, MIME?)
Maybe a function to change buffer size later on?
