support routines for http requests? (query strings, MIME?)
Maybe a function to change buffer size later on?
Document !.wbufsize and !rbufsize ???

Before submitting still to do:

version number into archive name
read manual once completely
check return values on the C level (are they always fail for error?)
Add a warning to the documentation about architecture dependence
Test on windows
Improve installation instructions, in particular for windows
Improve README file
Preface properly.
More examples, better manual chapter.
