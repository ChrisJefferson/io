getpid and others --> need to update autoconf files in main GAP

Fix "platform.g" test with latest additions.

future:

??? access to utime/utimes?

add some checks to GAP's autoconf configure script to test for more
headers, for example:
  netinet/in.h
  netinet/ip.h
  netinet/tcp.h
possibly some Linux-specific things:
  linux/in.h ???
More tests?
More examples?

(far) future:

support routines for http requests? (query strings, MIME?)
Maybe a function to change buffer size later on?
Unicode?
